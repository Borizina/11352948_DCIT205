My Dcit205 Project
The website functions as the Computer Science Department's online platform, offering a thorough and easily navigable resource for visitors, teachers, and students.
It provides details about departmental activities, academic programs, resources, events, and more on ten pages specifically devoted to this purpose.
Accessibility and simple navigation are ensured by the responsive layout and user-friendly design on a range of devices. 
By serving as a primary point of information for anyone looking for information on the Computer Science Department, this website hopes to promote involvement, dialogue,
and knowledge exchange within the department.

**HOW I Cloned and set up the project.**
I build my project first on Visual Studio Code,then,
I started working on my project, it has not been  easy with me but with some helps of waiting youtube videos,
I was able to build my website containing many pages. I had challenges concern Forking and Pull Request (PR)_.
So after I was done with my project, I initaited and cloned my work with help of gitbash.
I was able to comit my work to github by gitbash prompt. Thank You
